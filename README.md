# Yet Another Version of Conway's Game of Life
*even with ***buttons***.*

and the terrible project structure

### just open ```GoL.jar```

#### or build it yourself: ```build.bat``` for Windows or ```build.sh``` for Linux/macOS

You can save configuration to
a file (without an extension), and load it later. Or create your own in this format:

```
400
20,20,0
21,21,0
22,21,0
22,20,0
22,19,0
```

where ```400``` is default field size, ```20,20,0``` is ```x,y,age```, coordinates and age of each cell
